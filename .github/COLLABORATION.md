# Team Collaboration Protocols

## Communication
- Use Slack for daily communication.
- Weekly standups via Zoom on Mondays at 10 AM.

## Code Review
- All pull requests should be reviewed by at least one team member before merging.
- Reviews should be completed within 48 hours of submission.

## Issue Assignment
- All issues should be assigned to the team member responsible for resolving them.
- Use GitHub issues for tracking tasks, bugs, and features.

## Branching Strategy
- The `main` branch holds the stable code.
- Use the `dev` branch for ongoing development.
- Create feature branches off `dev` for new features or fixes.
