# Explanation: What is Blue-Green Deployment?

Blue-Green Deployment is a technique to reduce downtime and risk.

## How It Works
- You have two identical environments: Blue (current) and Green (new).
- Deploy new code to Green.
- Test Green in isolation.
- Switch traffic from Blue to Green.
- Roll back by redirecting back to Blue if needed.

## Benefits
- Zero-downtime deployments
- Easy rollback
- Reliable production releases
